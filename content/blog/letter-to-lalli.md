### Celebrations

___
Dear Lalli, 

You decided to go study in the blink of an eye, and you went for it. 
Was it easy? Was it difficult? “Who cares!” You did it anyway. 

You landed an internship and navigated a new industry, proved yourself and landed a fulltime. 
Was it easy? Was it difficult? “Who cares!” You did it anyway. 

Now, you’re about to start that fulltime now. Amid doubts, disappointments, hope, and excitement. Is it going to be easy? Is it going to be difficult? “Who cares!” You’ll do it anyway. 

___
I’m so proud of you. Do you know that? You remind me of a hopeful sailor centuries ago, standing on the shore and looking west. Thinking “If I endure these rough oceans, I get to see what’s on the other side”. Then she gets on the fucking ship and makes it to America. There might be rough seas, tides, unknown dangers, but she goes for it. 

You’re her. First you did that with a complete domain switch to tech pm. Next country and pace switch from earning to studying. 

(You might think - so many people do this. Of course anybody can apply to a course and go there, but you did it at at time in life that is way uncommon and challenging.)

Now that you’re about to start at your fulltime, I wanted to remind you of your journey. This is you, your ethos. A mighty woman who goes after what she wants without losing who she is.

### Little notes
Also wanted to remind you these little notes you may find useful.

- You’re not new to office jobs so it’s no big deal. You’ve worked for more than a decade, handled difficult and boring situations. This will be no different. ==You got this.== 
- Slow down, be methodical, make plenty of notes.
- Read slowly, read deeply, make plenty of notes.
- Slow, detailed work trumps fast work in the long run.
- Become the one stop person that everyone comes to for product related things.
- As long as you’re learning and growing, the hurdles along the way will be worth it.
- Why do any of this? Because hard things make us. Hard things give us a sense of achievement. Easy things rarely do.
- Also, have fun :)
