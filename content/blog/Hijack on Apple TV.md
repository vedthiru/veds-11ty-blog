### Brief
- It’s a show about about a plane hijack between Dubai and London.
- Idris Elba is the lead

### My Review
It starts off a bit slow, but by the end of the first episode it picks up pace. The pace of narration through each episode is maintained. There was no sudden increase in drama / suspense or episodes where things get stale. 

Now that I think of it, the journey between Dubai to London is around 7 hours, and the show has 7 episodes of 1 hour each. So they’ve covered well what happens pretty much the entire duration of plane journey. 

Another thing I quite liked is they have not gone too deep into each character’s backstory. They’ve shown just a bit - enough to know how it impacts the characters and their actions on the plane. I can compare it to dipping a biscuit in tea - dip it too much and it breaks up. 

The whole cast have acted very well. I could feel each characters emotions in that moment. Idris Elba of course has absolutely killed it. There was one moment where the character has to confront feeling powerless and like he loses control, and man did he nail it. 

The final episode had me on the edge of my seat and even had me emotional at times. If there was one thing I’d complain about, it was the last few moments of the show where some drama ensues before everything has been rounded out. I felt this could’ve been avoided as this added little value. 

Overall, I rate this show 4.5 on 5 stars.
